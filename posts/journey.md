If you want to do something, you just have to study and try it !

I learned C++ and Assembly at the university --- I'm not good student --- but I almost forgot them because I never used them in my job. I created some scripts for Autodesk Revit, Autodesk AutoCAD and Microsoft Excel for my last job. I realized that, I'm in love with algorithms and to developing something useful. In the end, I decided to change my carrier path into programming and thus I started my journey in May.

Firstly I start to learn HTML,CSS,Javascript from #FreeCodeCamp, #LinkedIn Learning, Stackoverflow and of course Youtube. I was employed full time as an electrical design engineer during the day and when I was came at home from the work, I started to learn web developing during the evenings and nights. I got some certificates from FreeCodeCamp and LinkedIn Learning. At the time I worked very seriously. I was sleeping 4--5 hours a day. This lifestyle continued until October.

I received very good news in the first days of October. My friend, a software developer, talked to his boss about me. He mentioned how hard I worked and that I could be a good employee for his company. They called me for a job interview and it passed very well. They gave me a full stack prework , I finished it quickly and successfully. I used HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), PHP and MSQL.

I succeeded !!!

### I started to working as a Full Stack Developer on November !

My life has changed.I finished my first task! I'm still learning. I'm at the beginning of the road yet. I'm still amazed when I look at the change in my life in five months. I'm very excited for new experiences.
